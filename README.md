# *Real* Colllege Experience
## Inspiration
I was inspired by one of the example ideas given in the rules doc. It went something like "make something to help kids distance learning get more out of college" and I thought, you know, classes are important and all. But what are people *really* missing out on when they can't go in person?

## Description
I am approaching the Education project track. I feel this will be vital in ensuring student's get the most out of school even in extenuating circumstances like what happened during the novel coronavirus pandemic.

## Ethics
This project is incredibly ethical. Even without the pandemic this project strives to help students who cant come to college because of medical issues such as immunodeficiency, or who have too many responsibilities and obligations to get out of the house and party. This project also helps to prevent the harmful side effects of actually playing beer pong.

## What it does
It's a small stupid little game that emulates the universal college party experience.

## How I built it
The entire project is programmed in the [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language. As for major libraries, I used the [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine, as well as some minor ones and a lot of caffeine. For the physics i used the [rapier](https://rapier.rs/) physics engine, and I also used a free 3d model of a solo cup I found online.

## How It Works
Basically It's just some collision detection and some logic to spawn the balls. It's not that much but as with all things it took a lot of time and effort. I then build it with WASM to throw it on a website and we're good to go.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
 * I made beer pong
 * Bullet Point 2
 * Bullet Point 3
